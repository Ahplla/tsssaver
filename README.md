# TSS Saver

An iOS app for [TSSSaver](https://tsssaver.1conan.com/).

# Compiling 

1. Install theos
    * Please note: you will need swift 4.0.3, and [kabir's theos fork](https://github.com/kabiroberai/theos/tree/better-swift-support) for better swift support. When this is merged into upstream, this requirement will no longer be needed.
2. Run `make do` to install the app to your device
3. :profit:

An xcodeproject will provided that will allow you to edit the app as normal in Xcode, and uses the makefile to run the app.
